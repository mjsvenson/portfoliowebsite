                  Hello there! My name is Matthew Svenson and this is my Portfolio website! I was born in Melrose Massachusetts on April 4th 2002. 
                  Ever since middle school I have had a passion for Computer Science, during any downtime I had in school I would mess around with HTML learning
                  how to make basic websites and outside of school I was learning how to mod minecraft and learning how to port forward to create my own minecraft server.
                  My passion was put into my classes when I had gone into Computing classes within my highschool where I first encountered object oriented programming 
                  with the class being entirely in Java. I completed that class and got a 4 on my AP Computer Science exam.
